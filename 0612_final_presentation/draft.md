1. 回顧（Quick Recap）
   - 研究主題： How does Single Parent Family Affect Children’s Human Capital Investment
   - 研究動機
     - Single parent family might fail to provide children with stable environment for learning
     - We aim to estimate the negative impact on children’s education attainment

2. 資料集介紹（來源、樣本、敘述統計）
   - TEPS：按照出生年可分為 SH, CPNP 兩群樣本，個別樣本數皆為 20000 左右
   - **敘述統計（？）**
   
3. 研究變數與實證方法介紹（變數的定義、PDS）
   - 變數的定義
   - baseline, control, PDS 三個迴歸模型結果
   
4. 初步結果

   1. Result tables with simple control
      1. SH
      2. NPCP
      3. No significant difference?
   2. Result tables with PDS method
      1. SH
      2. NPCP
      3. Significant difference?

   –> Surprisingly, SH and CP groups have different outcomes. It is possible that they faces different Education system.

5. 未來方向

   1. Focus on the difference between two groups:
      1. Check the divorce rate to see whether there’s significantly different in two groups. 
      2. See more datas about the High education reform in 2000s and check whether NPCP group are exactly affected by the policy. 
   2. Try to explain the panel that have more negative effect (mediation analysis):
      1. Because the accompany time?
      2. Because of the economic condition?
